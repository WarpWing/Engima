# Engima: A new way to utilize Multipass
 [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/) 
 
Hello! My name is WarpWing and I'm writing this README to inform you of this CLI tool codenamed Engima! Engima is a Text User Interface tool for navigating the [Multipass VM System](https://multipass.run/) by Canonical

# What does it do? 
It only does basic operations at the moment but I'll probably add more functionality soon. 
- Creating a Instance
- Shell into a Instance
- Deleting a Instance
- Stopping a Instance
- Purging/Permanently Deleting a Instance
- Recovering a Instance
# What could it do in the future
Later on, I plan to include the following 
- Ansible Registration 
- Cloudinit Support 
- Pip3 Package Intergration 
- Multi Worker Registration with Kubernetes
# Installation(Manuel)
To install it, please do the following 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/WarpWing/MultipassSimplified.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
sudo chmod +x engima 
sudo cp engima /usr/bin/engima
```
